Unboxing Robo C2
---------------

Now that you've received your Robo C2, it's time to unbox it and get familiar with your printer and accessories.

Your C2 is housed in 3 styrofoam pieces, secured together by a nylon strap. Simply lift the printer from the box using the strap and set it down.

Unclip the black nylon strap and remove the two halves of the top styrofoam shell.

Finally, using the handholds on the bottom of your C2, lift the printer out of the bottom styrofoam piece.

.. tip:: Save your printer box, nylon strap, foam inserts, and inclusions box for transportation. Also, you might need the original packaging to exercise your warranty or ship your printer in the future.

The printer's accessories are stored in the inclusions box inside the printer. Simply slide the inclusion box out and be sure to remove the foam.

Now we are ready to take off the additional shipping material and zip ties. There are 4 orange rod holders that need to be taken off. Simply push on the clip and it will come off. There is one at each corner of the top gantry

Initial set-up
---------------
Now let’s move forward with your initial set-up of Robo C2.

First, insert the spool holder into the rear slot of the printer.

   :align: center

Inside the toolbox you will find the hotend cover. Go ahead and take that out and place it over the hotend. It is held in with magnets so it just pops right in.

   :align: center

From here you’ll want to connect the power cord to the designated area on the back of the printer and then plug it into an AC outlet.

Now go ahead and turn on the printer.

Loading filament
---------------

To begin loading filament, hang your filament spool on the spool holder. Be sure to unroll at least 11”— or 30 centimeters — of filament and thread it through the base of the filament sensor block and into the filament feed tube.

Continue feeding the filament through the filament feed tube until it reaches the extruder. Then, press the extruder button and feed the filament into the printer’s gears.

Removing the test print
---------------

When the test print is complete and cooled down, remove the print bed with the finished print still in place by lifting the bed up and away from the magnets. Slowly slide the print bed out of the machine with both hands. Now, carefully flex the print bed from several positions to help loosen the print from the print bed. Repeat this process until the most of the print is loose from the bed. Carefully remove the print from the print bed with your hand.

.. image:: images/Removing-Print.gif
   :alt: Removing Print From Bed
   :align: center

Note that if the print is not coming loose after flexing the print bed, put the bed back in Robo C2 and use the provided spatula to carefully remove the print at its borders. Then slowly work your way underneath the print until it’s loose. Don’t force the print loose by pulling it up directly up from the print bed, since this may cause your print to break.

Connecting to Wi-Fi
---------------

We highly recommend connecting Robo C2 to your Wi-Fi network. Doing so provides you with necessary updates that allows for a more enjoyable 3D printing experience.


.. note:: You can also use the provided Ethernet cable (LAN) to connect Robo C2 directly to your Wi-Fi network.
