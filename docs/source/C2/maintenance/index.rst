Remember, a well-maintained Robo C2 is a happy one!

Be sure to check for the following before every print:
-----

   - Make sure the print bed is free of any/all objects
   - Make sure nothing is blocking the extruder head from moving freely around the build area.
   - Make sure no objects are below the print bed that could prevent it from freely moving up and down.
   - Make sure there are no broken pieces of filament within the extruder.
   - Make sure all cords are neatly tucked away to avoid unnecessary accidents while the printer is in operation.
   - Make sure all of your software is up to date (on screen prompts will let you know when updates are available, but only if you are connected to a Wi-Fi network).

And to ensure the best 3D printing experience now and in the future, use the following Robo C2 maintenance tips regularly (every 6-12 months, depending on use):

Cleaning the feeder gear
-----

Steps to take to clean your feeder gear

1. First, turn off your machine and remove the extruder cover.

2. Once that is off, go ahead and use a toothbrush to brush the feed gear to remove debris.
3. Rotate the feeder gear by turning the motor shaft by hand and repeat steps until the entire feeder gear is cleaned.
4. Place the extruder cap back onto the top of your extruder assembly and plug in Robo C2.

Lubricating the axis
-----

There are two types of linear rods, and two types of bearings in Robo C2, and they must be lubricated differently to ensure best prints.

White Lithium Grease
   - The rods that carry the extruder head are ball bearings and should be lubricated with a white-lithium grease to ensure smooth travel.
   - The z-axis lead screw also needs a white lithium grease for lubrication. Dap a small amount onto the rod, and let the printer move up and down from the next print to lubricate itself.

3-in-1 Oil
   - The x and y brackets have a smooth bushing inside of them, and need to be lubricated once every 2-4 months. Wipe down the build up that these bearing produce on the rods over time with a cleaning agent. The bearings can be greased with a few drops of 3-in-1 oil, or sewing machine oil to lubricate sufficiently.

Cleaning the print bed surface
-----

- The Robo C2 print bed surface is a sheet of black painters tape. Make sure to clean it with rubbing alcohol to ensure your print sticks to its surface.
- After 15 or 20 prints, you may need to replace this sheet if you see that your prints are not sticking to it. Ensure that the print sheet is laid completely flat on the build platform, and that it is flush and level across the surface.
- When you run out of print surfaces, you can order more at www.robo3d.com.
- When removing and replacing the entire print bed, double check that its magnets align with the magnets on the platform to ensure it is seated correctly. Build platforms that arenâ€™t seated correctly will result in failed prints.


Replacing your Hotend Nozzle
-----
Follow these steps to remove your hotend nozzle
1. Make sure to turn your Robo C2 off, and unplug the power cord from the back of the machine
2. Remove the magnetic extruder plate to expose your entire hotend and wires

3. The allen screw located on the front aluminum plate is the tensioner that holds your hotend in place. It is likely that this has come loose. Grab the allen wrench out of the the tool kit that came with your printer.
4. Loosen your hotend by turning the tensioner screw counterclockwise a few turns.

5. When the hex screw is loose enough, your hotend should be able to fall out of its housing
6. Carefully pull the wires by hand to remove them from their housings
7. Place new hotend in by reversing these steps
8. Push the hotend as far as it can go up into the seated ring and make sure it is flat against it.
9. While you are holding it there, screw the allen screw clockwise until you feel a good amount of resistance and the hotend cannot be pulled out with your hand. Make sure you align the heater block to be parallel with the front of the extruder so the hotend cover will lay flat against the magnets when reinstalling.

10. Turn the printer back on and test.
