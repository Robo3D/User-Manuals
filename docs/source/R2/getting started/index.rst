Unboxing Robo R2
---------------

Now that you've received your Robo R2, it's time to unbox it and get familiar with your printer and accessories.

Your R2 is housed in 2 styrofoam pieces, secured together by a top and bottom box. Simply undo the 3 clips at the bottom of the box by pinching in and pulling, then slip the top box off.

.. tip:: Save your printer box, foam inserts, and inclusions box for transportation. Also, you might need the original packaging to exercise your warranty or ship your printer in the future.

The printer's accessories are stored in the inclusions box inside the printer. First, you will need to take off the zip tie securing the door shut to access this inclusions box.
